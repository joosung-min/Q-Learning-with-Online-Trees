Authors: Joosung Min, Lloyd T. Elliott 

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03771

Simulations are based on OpenAI's gym envirionments:

* Blackjack-v0, CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2

Codes: 

* DQN_runAlg.py: contains codes for deep Q-learning.

* utils.py, ORF_module.py: contains necessary classes and functions for online random forests.

* ORF_runAlg.py: performs Q-learning using online random forests as Q-function approximators.
